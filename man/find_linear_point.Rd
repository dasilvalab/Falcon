\title{Find the Linear Point in a LOESS Fit}
\usage{
find_linear_point(mean_values, cv_values, lowess.f, window_size = 50)
}
\arguments{
\item{mean_values}{A numeric vector representing the mean values of the input data. These values correspond to the x-axis values used in the LOESS fit.}

\item{cv_values}{A numeric vector representing the coefficient of variation (CV) values of the input data. These values correspond to the y-axis values used in the LOESS fit.}

\item{window_size}{An integer specifying the number of points to consider in each sliding window when calculating local slopes. The default is 5.}

\item{lowess_fit}{A list containing the results of the LOESS fit, typically generated by the \code{lowess} function in R. The list should have elements \code{x} (mean values) and \code{y} (predicted CV values).}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the mean value at the point where the LOESS curve becomes approximately linear after the peak. If no such point is found, the function returns \code{NULL}.
}
\description{
This function identifies a point in a LOESS (Locally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing) fit where the curve transitions from a peak to an approximately linear region. The function is useful in cases where it is important to detect the onset of linear behavior in a smoothed curve, such as in quality control or trend analysis.
}
\details{
The function first identifies the peak of the LOESS curve (the maximum predicted value). It then examines the region after the peak to detect where the curve transitions to a linear slope by fitting small linear models across a sliding window of points. The point at which the slope stabilizes is considered the onset of linearity.
